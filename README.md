# Exmicror

Welcome to the central repository of Exmicror, a leading manufacturer and distributor of hand sanitizers. This project encapsulates the essential database that underpins our operations. From order management to inventory control and customer interactions, Exmicror-DB is the heart of our infrastructure.

## Project structure

- **`/sql`**: Contains the `init.sql` script for database initialization.
- **`/docs`**: Relevant documentation for the development and use of the database.
- **`/dump`**: Directory containing CSV files for test data. Data is automatically loaded into the database on container startup.

## Environment setup

1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:DieeegoFC/Exmicror-DB.git`
2. Ensure you have Docker installed in your environment.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and provide the necessary database credentials.

```env
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
```

## Start database with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The database will be available at localhost:5432 with the credentials specified in the docker-compose.yml file.
